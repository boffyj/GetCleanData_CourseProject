UCI Human Activity Dataset Codebook
=============================
# Summary
UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset was formed with an experiment with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Six different types of activities were recorded using a Samsung Galaxy SII smartphone: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying. 

Using embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of the smartphone, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz was captured. This data originally was divided into train and test sets in a ratio of 70%/30%.

Additionally, the deposited data was not in its raw form. The sensor signals were claimed to be pre-processed by applying noise filters. Futhermore, filtered data were sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

To summarize, for each record, following properties were recorded:
* 3-axial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
* 3-axial angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
* Activity label. 
* Subject identifier that shows who carried out the experiment.

For presenting the data each vector were normalized and bounded within [-1,1]. Additionally, each feature vector was presented as a row on the text file.

# Processing

Downloaded dataset was saved into a folder named **"data"**, located as a subfolder of the script's location. All data operations were performed in this folder. The pre-processed and deposited data was further processed to obtain a smaller, summarized dataset. In order to achieve this, following steps were performed:

1. Initially, train and test data were merged into a single dataset.
2. Only calculated mean and standard deviations of variables were used in the merged dataset. This step selected 66 features from a total of 561 features.
3. Mean of each mean and standard deviation measurement was taken for each activity type and each subject of the experiment, reducing the dataset size from 10299 to 180 rows. 
4. Descriptive activity labels and subject information was integrated into dataset.
5. Variable names were changed into more suitable names by changing function notation to names, and replacing hyphens with dots.
5. Cleaned and tidied dataset was saved into a tab-seperated text file.

A new, independent, clean dataset after running the script can be found in the script folder, instead of the aforementioned "data" folder, with "tidyData.txt" name.
